(node:2968) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///app/tailwind.config.ts?id=1769861718456 is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /app/package.json.
