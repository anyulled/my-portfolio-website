(node:5784) [DEP0060] DeprecationWarning: The `util._extend` API is deprecated. Please use Object.assign() instead.
(Use `node --trace-deprecation ...` to show where the warning was created)
(node:6577) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///app/tailwind.config.ts?id=1770122493567 is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to /app/package.json.
