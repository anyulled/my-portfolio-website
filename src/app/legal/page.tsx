          </p>
          <p>
            The user will be liable for damages of any kind that Sensuelle

          </p>
          <h2>FIFTH.- RULES OF CONDUCT</h2>
          <p>
            Users may contact Sensuelle Boudoir and interact in certain sections
            of the website, either through the Blog or by sharing sections on
            social networks, provided that they respect this code of conduct:
          </p>
          <p>
            NO USER MAY IMPERSONATE ANOTHER PERSON OR ORGANIZATION, otherwise
            they may incur a misdemeanor or crime according to the Penal Code
            and the Spanish Civil Code. DISRESPECTFUL AND OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE MAY
            NOT BE USED. Messages containing threats, serious insults or any
            other type of comment that may offend sensibilities are not
            acceptable. In such cases, Sensuelle Boudoir reserves the right to
            remove any content that contravenes this condition and to exercise
            the appropriate legal means. It is ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED to present,
            cite and recommend companies or web portals, and in general to carry
            out marketing or spam actions. This type of content will be deleted
            along with the accounts that carried out such action and even
            brought to the attention of the Spanish Data Protection Agency.
          </p>
          <h2>SIXTH.- PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>
          All the contents of the Website, such as texts, opinion articles,
          graphics, photographs, logos, icons, images, as well as the graphic
          design, source code and software, are the exclusive property of Daniel
          Blanco or third parties, whose rights in this regard are legitimately
          held by Daniel Blanco, and are therefore protected by national and
          international legislation.
          <p>
            The use of all elements subject to industrial and intellectual
            property for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited, as is their
            distribution, modification, alteration or decompilation.
          </p>
          <h2>SEVENTH.- EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY</h2>
          <p>
            Daniel Blanco reserves the right to interrupt access to the services
            at any time and without prior notice, whether for technical,
            security, control, maintenance reasons, power supply failures or for
            any other justified reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consequently, Daniel Blanco does not guarantee the reliability,
            availability or continuity of the Website or the Services, so the
            use of the same by users is carried out at their own risk, and
            Daniel Blanco cannot be held liable in any way in this regard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, Daniel Blanco does not assume any liability arising
            from, by way of example but not limited to:
          </p>
          <p>
            The use that users make of the materials available on the website,
            whether prohibited or permitted, in violation of the intellectual
            and/or industrial property rights of the content of the website
            itself or of third-party portals. Any damages and losses to users
            caused by normal or abnormal operation of the search tools, the
            organisation or location of the content and/or access to the
            services and, in general, errors or problems that arise in the
            development or implementation of the technical elements that make up
            the service. The content of those pages that users can access from
            links included on the website. From acts or omissions of third
            parties, regardless of whether these third parties may be linked to
            Daniel Blanco by contractual means.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise, Daniel Blanco excludes any liability for damages of any
            kind that may be due to the presence of viruses or the presence of
            other harmful elements in the content that may cause alterations in
            the computer systems as well as in the documents or systems stored
            therein, so Daniel Blanco will not be liable in any case when the
            following occur:
          </p>
          <p>
            Errors or delays in access to the services by the user when entering
            their data in the corresponding form or any anomaly that may arise
            when these incidents are due to problems in the Internet network,
            causes of chance or force majeure and any other unforeseeable
            contingency beyond the good faith of Daniel Blanco. Failures or
            incidents that may occur in communications, deletion or incomplete
            transmissions, so that it is not guaranteed that the website
            services are constantly operational. Errors or damages caused to the
            website due to inefficient and bad faith use of the service by the
            user. Non-operation or problems with the email address provided by
            the user to send the requested information.
          </p>
          <p>
            In any case, Daniel Blanco undertakes to solve any problems that may
            arise and to offer all necessary support to the user to reach a
            quick and satisfactory solution to the incident.
          </p>
          <h2>EIGHTH.- LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h2>
          <p>
            Daniel Blanco does not guarantee or assume any type of
            responsibility for damages suffered by accessing the
            Services/content of third parties through connections, links or
            links of the linked sites or for the accuracy or reliability of the
            same. The function of the links that appear on Daniel Blanco is
            exclusively to inform the user about the existence of other sources
            of information on the Internet, where they can expand the Services
            offered by the Portal. Daniel Blanco will not be responsible in any
            case for the result obtained through said links or for the
            consequences that arise from the access by the users to them. These
            Services of third parties are provided by them, so Daniel Blanco
            cannot control and does not control the legality of the Services or
            their quality. Consequently, the user must exercise extreme caution
            in the evaluation and use of the information and services existing
            in the contents of third parties.
          </p>

            The introduction of hyperlinks for commercial purposes on websites
            other than Daniel Blanco that allow access to this web portal
            without the express consent of Daniel Blanco is expressly
            prohibited. In any case, the existence of hyperlinks on websites
            other than the company will not imply in any case the existence of
            commercial or business relations with the owner of the website where
            the hyperlink is established, nor the acceptance by Daniel Blanco
          </p>
