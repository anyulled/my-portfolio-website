## 2026-01-27 - [LCP Optimization: Server-Side Random Selection]
**Learning:** Client-side random content selection (e.g., hero images) forces `mounted` checks to avoid hydration mismatches, delaying the rendering of critical content (LCP) until after JavaScript execution.
**Action:** Move random selection logic to Server Components and pass the selected content as props to Client Components. This allows the server to send the initial HTML with the hero image immediately, enabling the browser to discover and preload the resource significantly earlier.
